## What
Arcadian is a safe haven/garbage dump where original stories and light essays get to see the light of day. Whether they should or not is up for discussion. Feel free to share your thoughts wherever.

In all honesty, this is just a place where I can post things that I want to share. Short things, long things, things inbetween. It's a great help to have a dedicated place, one under your own jurisdiction, to put your work like a self-indulgent child puts up their own mediocre-at-best drawings on the fridge. We all need a fridge.

## Who
My name is Matt. I'm a university student majoring in psychology. I'm also a writer of fiction, and a general haver of thoughts that I sometimes write down. My interests are broad, but often circle the philosophical, psychological, theological, and humor-related. I'm a dumbass in ~many~ most topics, but I enjoy learning and am learning to enjoy whatever comes my way. 

Hopefully, some of the things I create spark something in others. As much as I like to talk nonsense, I really hope to share things I care about, and reach others doing so. That's what this is all about. Whether it is just a chuckle, or a series of mind-blowing epiphanies (doubtful, but oh well), I want to add to the spheres thoughts and stories that have helped me in so many ways throughout my life.
So let me know how I'm doing or how I can improve ;)
